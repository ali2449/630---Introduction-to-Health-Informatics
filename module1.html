It can be divided into five key periods, starting in the 1950s in the USA and later expanding to Europe and other regions. In the 1940s, German doctor Gustav Wagner founded the first professional organization for informatics, laying foundational concepts for data processing in healthcare. By the 1950s, pioneers like Robert Ledley utilized digital computers for dental projects at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, marking one of the initial forays into computational medicine. In 1959, Ledley and Lee B. Lusted published "Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis," which introduced computing techniques to medical professionals and laid the groundwork for diagnostic algorithms.</p>
                    <p>The 1960s saw the establishment of specialized university departments and training programs in Europe, including France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invested heavily in biomedical research centers, spending over $40 million between 1960 and 1964. Key developments included the creation of MEDLINE and MEDLARS by the National Library of Medicine in 1965, which revolutionized access to medical literature through computerized indexing and retrieval systems.</p>
                    <p>The 1970s brought advancements in expert systems, such as MYCIN for infectious disease diagnosis at Stanford University, which used rule-based AI to recommend antibiotics, and Internist-I for internal medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. The Massachusetts General Hospital developed MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), a programming language that became foundational for clinical applications, including the U.S. Veterans Affairs' VistA system, which is still in use today for managing veteran health records across the country.</p>
                    <p>The 1980s and 1990s witnessed the formation of international organizations like the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) in 1967 and the growth of subfields such as nursing informatics. The earliest EHRs appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with systems like the Regenstrief Medical Record System in Indiana. In the 2000s, policy initiatives like the U.S. Executive Order 13335 (2004) established national coordinators for health IT. Today, health informatics continues to evolve with big data, AI, and global standards, as seen in the rapid deployment of contact tracing apps during the 2020 pandemic.</p>
